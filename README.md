# k8s-go

## Description

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is a project for summarizing working experience before. I develop each service individually
in my free time. After all service is done, Iâ€™ll refactor these services to fix micro system architecture.

### Feature

- For client, user can use api after loging in by oauth verfication and getting jwt token.
- For admin, maneger can manage admin manager's permissions, users, oauth clients and scopes via admin console.

### Target

1. Go with Gin framework as API server
2. Oauth 2.0 authorization code flow
3. Oauth scope management
4. Casbin authorization library
5. Docker + Kubernetes
6. Batch deployment
7. Service monitoring
